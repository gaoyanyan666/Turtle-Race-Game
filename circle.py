'''
create antoher race that moves the turtles in diffferent lanes on a circular track. Use 4 concentric circles to construct the track and have each turtle race within the track between the circles.

l: race distance
s: speed in range(1,5)
r: radius

round is the rounds that turtle needs to run


l = 2(math.pi)r * round
round = l/[turtle.radians()*r]
extend=(180L)/(Ï€r)


## Function to calculate the number of steps based on the distance
#def calculate_steps(radius):
#    #circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius
#    rounds =1 #distance / circumference
#    steps = int(rounds * 360)  # Convert rounds to steps (degrees)
#    return steps

 
## Function to make a turtle move in a circle
#def move_in_circle(turtle, radius, steps):
#    circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius
#    step_length = circumference / steps
    
#    for _ in range(steps):
#        turtle.forward(step_length)
#        turtle.left(360 / steps)
